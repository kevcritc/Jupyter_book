    "### How Do Nanoparticles Target Cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nanoparticles can reach and act on tumours using two strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Passive Targeting\n",
    "- Tumours have **leaky blood vessels** and poor lymphatic drainage.\n",
    "- Nanoparticles accumulate in tumours due to the **Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR)** effect.\n",
    "- No specific targeting involved ‚Äì relies on tumour environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî∏ Active Targeting\n",
    "- Tumour cells **overexpress specific receptors or transporters**.\n",
    "- Nanoparticles are **decorated with ligands** that bind to these receptors.\n",
    "- The cell ‚Äúthinks‚Äù it‚Äôs internalising something useful and brings the nanoparticle inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üß™ Active targeting requires **chemical modification** of the nanoparticle surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíä Benefits of Using Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Improved Drug Properties\n",
    "- Many anti-cancer drugs are:\n",
    "  - **Hydrophobic** (poorly soluble in water)\n",
    "  - **Unstable** (degraded quickly in blood or excreted)\n",
    "- Nanoparticles:\n",
    "  - **Increase drug solubility**\n",
    "  - **Prolong circulation time**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reduced Side Effects\n",
    "- More **targeted drug delivery** ‚Üí fewer drugs affect healthy cells.\n",
    "- Requires **lower doses** for effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Better Drug Delivery\n",
    "- Nanoparticles can:\n",
    "  - Cross biological barriers (e.g., **blood-brain barrier**, skin)\n",
    "  - Deliver drugs to **specific tissues or cells**\n",
    "  - Accumulate selectively in **diseased organs**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Controlled Drug Release\n",
    "- Nanoparticles can be engineered to:\n",
    "  - Release drugs **slowly over time** (sustained release)\n",
    "  - Release drugs in response to **stimuli**:\n",
    "    - **pH**\n",
    "    - **Temperature**\n",
    "    - **Enzymes**\n",
    "    - **Light**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Enhanced Diagnostics and Imaging\n",
    "- Nanoparticles allow **early and sensitive disease detection**\n",
    "  - E.g. **Lab-on-a-chip**, **single-cell analysis**, **bioMEMs**\n",
    "- Act as **contrast agents** in:\n",
    "  - MRI\n",
    "  - CT scans\n",
    "  - Ultrasound\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## ü©∫ Theranostic Nanoparticles\n",
    "\n",
    "> üìò \"Theranostics\" = **Therapy** + **Diagnostics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multifunctional** nanoparticles:\n",
    "  - Deliver drugs **and**\n",
    "  - Track drug **location and effectiveness**\n",
    "- Combines:\n",
    "  - Drug delivery\n",
    "  - Imaging\n",
    "  - Stimuli-responsive release\n",
    "  - Active targeting\n",
    "  - Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- Some nanoparticles are coated with drugs + fluorescent dyes or metals (e.g., gold or iron oxide) for **dual purpose** use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Toxicology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological Risks:\n",
    "- Nanoparticles have:\n",
    "  - **Small size**\n",
    "  - **High surface area**\n",
    "  - **High chemical reactivity**\n",
    "- Can cause:\n",
    "  - **Toxicity**\n",
    "  - **Immune reactions**\n",
    "  - **Accumulation in organs**\n",
    "  - **Unexpected side effects**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thorough **preclinical testing** is essential before human trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preclinical Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **In Vitro** (‚Äúin glass‚Äù):\n",
    "- Performed in test tubes or petri dishes\n",
    "- Useful for early screening\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **In Vivo** (‚Äúin life‚Äù):\n",
    "- Performed in living organisms (e.g. mice)\n",
    "- Provides information on:\n",
    "  - **Absorption**\n",
    "  - **Distribution**\n",
    "  - **Metabolism**\n",
    "  - **Excretion**\n",

    "## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical & Social Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sustainability and Environment\n",
    "- Need guidelines for:\n",
    "  - **Occupational exposure** (lab safety)\n",
    "  - **Environmental impact** (waste disposal)\n",
    "- Long-term effects in ecosystems are **not well understood**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regulation and Policy\n",
    "- **No one-size-fits-all**: Every nanomaterial is different.\n",
    "- Regulatory bodies:\n",
    "  - **EMA** ‚Äì European Medicines Agency\n",
    "  - **FDA** ‚Äì U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n",
    "  - **ISO**, **CEN** ‚Äì Standards organizations\n",
    "  - **EPA** ‚Äì U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Socioeconomic Considerations\n",
    "- **Cost**, **access**, and **public perception** influence how nanomedicine is adopted.\n",
    "- Need transparent, inclusive dialogue between scientists, regulators, and the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nanoparticles improve cancer treatment by enhancing delivery, reducing side effects, and enabling imaging.\n",
    "- Theranostic platforms combine therapy and diagnosis in a single nanostructure.\n",
    "- Safety and ethics must be considered, including rigorous preclinical testing and public policy development.\n"
