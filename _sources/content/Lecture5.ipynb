    "- Electrons in an atom can only occupy certain **stable, non-radiating circular orbits** known as **stationary states**.\n",
    "- These orbits are **quantized**, meaning electrons cannot exist in between these orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.2.2 Second Postulate: Energy and Radiation**  \n",

    "  - $h$ is Planck’s constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 5.5.2.3 Third Postulate: Quantized Angular Momentum  \n",

    "  - $m$ is the electron’s mass.\n",

    "  - $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$ is the reduced Planck’s constant.\n",
