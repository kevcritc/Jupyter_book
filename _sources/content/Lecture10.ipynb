    "# 10 Introduction to Carbon Nanomaterials\n",
    "Nanomaterials are materials that have structural features at the nanometer scale, typically below 100 nm. Carbon nanomaterials exhibit unique mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them essential in modern technology.\n",

    "### 10.1 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical structures made entirely of **carbon atoms** arranged in a **hexagonal lattice**, similar to **graphene**. Imagine a sheet of graphene rolled into a seamless cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types:\n",
    "- **Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs)** – made of one graphene cylinder.\n",
    "- **Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs)** – multiple concentric graphene cylinders.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 10.1.1 Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can think of rolling up a sheet graphene, and the way it's rolled defines the properties of the CNT. In realisty this is not how CNTs are made - they are chemically synthesised and the starting material is not graphene!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.2 Chirality and Types\n",
    "The way the graphene is rolled is described by the **chiral vector** (**n, m**), which leads to different types of CNTs:\n",
    "- **Armchair (n = m):** Metallic\n",
    "- **Zigzag (m = 0 or n = 0):** Can be metallic or semiconducting\n",
    "- **Chiral (n ≠ m):** Usually semiconducting\n",

    "- Excellent **thermal conductors** along the tube (~3000–6000 W/m·K).\n",
    "- Poor heat conductors **across** the tube walls due to weak van der Waals forces.\n",
