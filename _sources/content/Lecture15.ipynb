    "### 15.1.2.1 Electrostatic Stabilisation of Nanoparticles\n",
    "\n",
    "- When nanoparticles are dispersed in a liquid, they may **acquire a surface charge** due to:\n",
    "  - Ionization of surface groups,\n",
    "  - Adsorption of ions from the surrounding medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This charge leads to the formation of an **electric double layer** around each particle:\n",
    "  1. **Stern layer**: tightly bound counter-ions near the surface.\n",
    "  2. **Diffuse layer**: more loosely bound ions extending into the liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As two charged particles approach, their electric double layers overlap, generating a **repulsive electrostatic force** that helps prevent aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **electrostatic repulsive force** between two like-charged particles can be described by **Coulomb’s Law**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $F = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r} \\cdot \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - $ F $ = electrostatic force,\n",
    "  - $q_1$, $q_2$ = charges on the particles,\n",
    "  - $ r$ = distance between particle centers,\n",

    "  - Stability arises when a **potential energy barrier** prevents particles from coming close enough to stick together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electrostatic stabilization is most effective in **polar solvents** (like water).\n",
    "- Increasing **ionic strength** (e.g., adding salt) compresses the double layer, **reducing the range of repulsion** and potentially leading to aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1.3 **Steric Hindrance: How It Works**\n",
    "- **Steric stabilization** prevents nanoparticles from sticking together by using **long-chain molecules or polymers** adsorbed onto the particle surface.\n",

    "#### 15.1.3.1 **Mechanism of Steric Hindrance**\n",
    "1. **Entropic Repulsion**:\n",
    "   - Overlapping polymer chains experience **compression**, reducing **entropy**.\n",
    "   - Since **entropy maximization is favored**, this leads to **repulsion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Excluded Volume Effect**:\n",
    "   - Polymer layers **physically occupy space**, preventing particles from **coming too close**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solvent Interaction**:\n",
    "   - In a **good solvent**, polymer chains remain **solvated** and steric hindrance is maximized.\n",
