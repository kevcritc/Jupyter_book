    "# 6 Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Classical mechanics fails to explain many phenomena observed in microscopic systems, such as the stability of atoms and the discrete energy levels of electrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, the **wavefunction (Ψ)** represents the state of a quantum system, and its square (|Ψ|²) or more exactly the complex conjugation $ \\Psi \\Psi^* $ gives the probability of finding a particle in a given region of space. The behavior of the wavefunction is governed by the **Schrödinger equation**, which determines the allowed energy levels of quantum systems.\n",

    "## 6.1 Wave-Particle Duality and Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.1 The Wave-Particle Duality\n",
    "- Matter and light exhibit both **wave-like and particle-like** properties.\n",
    "- Each particle has an associated **de Broglie wavelength**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{mv} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- This led to the concept of **quantised electron waves** around the nucleus.\n",
    "\n",

    "Fig 6.1 An cartoon of a 1D wavepacket representing a particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2 Quantum Mechanics \n",
    "- The Bohr model was an important step in understanding atomic structure, but **modern quantum mechanics** provides a more complete picture.\n",
    "- Instead of treating electrons as **orbiting particles**, quantum mechanics describes them as **waves** using a function called the **wavefunction** $ \\Psi(x,t) $, which contains all the information about the electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.3 The Schrödinger Equation \n",
    "The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics is the **Schrödinger equation**, which determines how the wavefunction $\\Psi$ behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.4 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation\n",
    "For an electron moving in an atom, we use the **time-independent Schrödinger equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\Psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\\Psi = E\\Psi $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} $ is the **reduced Planck's constant**.\n",
    "- $ m $ is the **mass of the electron**.\n",
    "- $ V(x) $ is the **potential energy** (for a hydrogen atom, this is the electrostatic attraction to the nucleus).\n",
    "- $ E $ is the **total energy** of the electron.\n",
    "- $ \\Psi(x) $ is the **wavefunction**, which tells us where the electron is **most likely** to be found.  \n",
    "It is interesting to note that apart from the complication of the partial differientials and $\\psi$ that the form is $K + U=E$.  The left hand side has a strage way of writting KE.  $KE= \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ which be written as $KE= \\frac{p}{2m}$where m is mass and p is momentum.  This is the form KE is in the Equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.5 In Three Dimensions (Spherical Form)\n",
    "Since atoms are three-dimensional, we use **spherical coordinates**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spherical coordinates](images/3dcoord.png)  \n",
    "Fig 6.2 Spherical coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You do not need to know this maths (this year)!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\Psi + V(r) \\Psi = E \\Psi $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\nabla^2 $ is the **Laplacian operator**, which accounts for the three-dimensional motion of the electron.\n",
    "- $ r $ is the **distance from the nucleus**.\n",
    "- $ V(r) = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} $ is the **Coulomb potential energy** from the nucleus.\n",
    "- The x, y, z coordinates are transformed into $r, \\theta, \\phi $ - the solutions will therefore by in **spherical coordinates**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.6 The Role of the Hamiltonian Operator\n",
    "The **Hamiltonian operator** $\\hat{H}$ represents the total energy of a quantum system. It consists of kinetic and potential energy terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H} \\Psi = E \\Psi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{H} $ is the Hamiltonian operator,\n",
    "- $ E $ is the total energy of the system,\n",
    "- $ \\Psi $ is the wavefunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian depends on the system being studied. In the case of an electron in an atom, the potential energy comes from the Coulomb attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 The One-Dimensional (1D) Box Problem\n",
    "One of the simplest quantum mechanical models is the **particle in a one-dimensional box**, where a particle is confined to move in a region with impenetrable walls. The wavefunction solutions are **standing waves**, and the allowed energy levels are **quantized**.  The eigenvalues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ n $ is a positive integer (quantum number),\n",
    "- $ h $ is Planck’s constant,\n",
    "- $ m $ is the mass of the particle,\n",
    "- $ L $ is the length of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantization of energy is a fundamental feature of quantum systems.\n",
    "![Soltion to 1D box with infinately high walls](images/1Dbox.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 6.3 The eigenfunctions to the 1D box are sine waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Quantum Numbers and Electron Configurations\n",
    "In three-dimensional quantum systems, such as atoms, the position of an electron is best described in **spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ)**. The quantum numbers that arise from solving the Schrödinger equation in this system determine the electron's allowed states.\n",

    "- Associated with the angle $ \\psi $\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.3 Spin Quantum Number (s)\n",
    "- Symbol: `s` \n",
    "- Values: `+½` (spin-up) or `-½` (spin-down)\n",
    "- Represents the **intrinsic angular momentum** (spin) of the electron.\n",
    "- Electrons in the same orbital must have opposite spins due to the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Atomic Orbitals and Their Shapes\n",
    "The solutions to the Schrödinger equation for an electron confined in a spherical potential define the **atomic orbitals**. These orbitals describe the probability of finding an electron in different regions of space around the nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **s-orbitals (`l = 0`)**: Spherical in shape, centered around the nucleus.\n",
    "- **p-orbitals (`l = 1`)**: Dumbbell-shaped, oriented along the x, y, and z axes.\n",
    "- **d-orbitals (`l = 2`)**: More complex shapes, often resembling cloverleaves.\n",
    "- **f-orbitals (`l = 3`)**: Even more intricate shapes, important in heavy elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "These orbitals do not describe **the path** of an electron but rather the regions where the electron is most likely to be found.\n",

    "4. **Electron Motion is Defined by Wavefunctions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.6 Electron Spin and the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n",
    "In addition to orbital angular momentum, electrons have an **intrinsic angular momentum**, known as **spin**. The concept of spin was first introduced by **Paul Dirac** through a relativistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spin quantum number (`s`)**: Takes values of `+½` or `-½`.\n",
    "- The **Stern-Gerlach experiment (1922)** provided experimental evidence for electron spin.\n",

    "> *No two fermions (such as electrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.6.1 Fermions vs. Bosons\n",
    "- **Fermions** (e.g., electrons, neutrons, protons) obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle and have **half-integer spin** (`±½`).\n",
