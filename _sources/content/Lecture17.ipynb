    "### 17.2.1 Primary Structure:\n",
    "- Linear sequence of amino acids\n",
    "- Linked by **peptide bonds** (between -COOH and -NH‚ÇÇ)\n",

    "### 17.2.3 Secondary Structure:\n",
    "- Local folding: **Œ±-helices** and **Œ≤-sheets**\n",
    "- Stabilized by **hydrogen bonding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.2.4 Tertiary Structure:\n",
    "- Full 3D shape of a single chain\n",
    "- Determined by interactions between side chains:\n",
    "  - Hydrophobic interactions\n",
    "  - Ionic bonds\n",
    "  - Disulfide bridges\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.2.5 Quaternary Structure:\n",
    "- Multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) form a larger complex\n",
    "- Example: Hemoglobin (4 subunits)\n",
