    "### 1. Amino Acids – The Basic Units of Proteins\n",
    "Each amino acid consists of:\n",
    "- A central (α) carbon\n",
    "- A **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH)\n",
    "- An **amine group** (-NH₂)\n",
    "- A **hydrogen atom**\n",
    "- A **variable side chain (R-group)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Think of amino acids like Lego blocks with different \"side arms\" – the R-group – that give each block its personality.\n",

    "### 2. Protein Structure Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are built from amino acids, and their function depends on the structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primary Structure:\n",
    "- Linear sequence of amino acids\n",
    "- Linked by **peptide bonds** (between -COOH and -NH₂)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secondary Structure:\n",
    "- Local folding: **α-helices** and **β-sheets**\n",
    "- Stabilized by **hydrogen bonding**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tertiary Structure:\n",
    "- Full 3D shape of a single chain\n",
    "- Determined by interactions between side chains:\n",
    "  - Hydrophobic interactions\n",
    "  - Ionic bonds\n",
    "  - Disulfide bridges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quaternary Structure:\n",
    "- Multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) form a larger complex\n",
    "- Example: Hemoglobin (4 subunits)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔍 **Key Insight**: A protein’s 3D shape (conformation) directly affects its function – misfolding might cause diseases e.g. has been liked Alzheimer’s but be careful it might be sypmtom rather than a cause.\n",
