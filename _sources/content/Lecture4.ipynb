    "\n",
    "There is a general method for solving scaling problems.  These basic steps can be applied generally and course if your maths is a strong you may see that you can take some short cuts!\n",

    "1. Identify or Derive the Governing Equation  \n",
    "    - Determine the fundamental equation that describes the system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify Length-Scale Terms  \n",
    "    - Locate terms in the equation that involve a length scale.  \n",
    "    - If necessary, use material property equations (e.g., density, conductivity, capacitance) to introduce length-dependent terms.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rearrange the Equation  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Convert to a Proportionality Expression  \n",
    "    - Replace the **equals sign** with **\"proportional to\" (∝)**.  \n",
    "    - Ensure the equation contains only the **target term** and **length scale terms (L's)**.  \n",
    "    - Set all other dimensionless constants to unity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Determine the Scaling Exponent  \n",
    "    - Rewrite the expression in the form $L^n$.  \n",
    "    - Identify the value of $n$ (e.g., 1, 2, -1/2) based on the proportionality relation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write Down Known Values for the Given Scale  \n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\right)^n $$\n",

    "$$ Q=-k_c A \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have $A$ which is an area and $x$ a distance so we can show that $Q \\propto L$\n",
    "\n",
    "However as the size reduced to microscopic scale $k_c$ which is a macroscopic material thermal conductivity constant starts to itself scale with size.  There we have, for L< 1µm,\n",

    " \n",
    " We can there say that $d \\propto \\lambda$, so here we are not using scaling by chacterisitic size as in the other examples.  Optics for this reason tends not to fit into scaling so well as it is dominated by the wavelength of the light.  There are likely examples such as diffraction that fit the pattern better.\n",
