    "If we take a piece of iron and split it, it's still iron - just a bit smaller.  Imagine if it was possible to keep splitting until it is not posible to split it anymore.  This is idea that the Greeks philosophers where thinking about.  Is it possible to split an infinte number of times or is there a limit (assuming tools is not the limitation).  We will come back to this idea in the next lecture.  For now, we know that atoms are the limit.\n",

    "**Key point** The mathematics of a classsically electron orbiting a proton are indentical to a planet orbiting the Sun in our solar system.  This latter solution maths was famously developed Newton who is the father of Mechanics and therefore it is unsuprising that, a couple of hundred years later, when it is applied to the atom it becomes known as'Quantum' Mechanics (QM).  In later lectures we will cover why this first model ultimately fails, but we will cover this as it is useful to understand the concepts and how they have developed. We will address Quantum mechanics in later lectures without worrying too much about the actual mathematics.  We will draw sketches of solutions rather than working about mathematical functions to try to make this topic inclusive.  Physics students will cover these models in detail as part of their core studies, but because of the importance of atoms to nanotechnology, we cannot wait for those QM models to fully explained for this course. \n",
