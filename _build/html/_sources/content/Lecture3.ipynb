    "\n",
    "### What are Scaling Laws?\n",
    "Scaling laws allow us to simplify complex systems by estimating how physical quantities change as the size of the system is scaled.  We as, physicsists, always make the simplist possible model and then add complexity - not the other way around.  Rather than worrying about multiple dimensions we will simplify objects as have a single characteristic size, L.\n",

    "- **Volume (V)**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the box in Fig 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ V = wht $\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Where `w`, `h`, and `t` are the width, height and thickness of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Surface Area (S)**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ S=2(tw +th +wh)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- When all dimensions are equal (`w = h = t = L`), the characteristic length (`L`) can be used to see how the volume and surface area change as we shrink or enlarge the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "- $ V \\propto L^3 $\n",
    "- $ S \\propto L^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:  \n",
    "- The surface area to volume ratio $ \\frac{S}{V} $ is inversely proportional to the characteristic length: $ \\frac{S}{V} \\propto \\frac{1}{L} $\n",
    "While this seems trival, it is a **keypoint** as we shrink object the surface area becomes much large compared to the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "1. **Heat Loss**: Heat loss to the environment is proportional to surface area. As objects get larger, the relative heat loss decreases.\n",
    "2. **Catalytic Activity**: Activity scales with surface area, so reducing volume of the catalyst (while maintaining the total mass) increases catalytic efficiency per unit mass.  This is a key for saving energy in chemical reactions.\n",

    "1. Humans native to colder climates tend to have higher average mass and shorter limbs. Higher mass and short limbs reduces the surface area meaning heat loss is lower.\n",

    "### How Properties Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "If a body has a mass, m, then we can write:\n",
    "$ m= \\rho V $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho $ is the density of the body.  Since $V \\propto\\ L^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mass**: $m \\propto L^3 $  \n",
    "  - The mass of bodies increase cubically with size (not suprising, but important for propagating the concept).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friction**: At the macro-scale, friction is **independent of the contact surface area**. However, at the nanoscale, friction and adhesion increase with contact area $ \\propto L^2 $.  Interestingly the understanding of friction at different scale is actually not fully understood.  What is the friction between to atoms? DOes it make sense to even call it friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wear and Lifetime (LT)**: Wear is related to device lifetime, as it scales with the thickness of the material. Thinner materials tend to have shorter lifetimes because erosion rates are linear. A pair of shoes with a thick sole last longer than a shoe with a thin sole.  In fact the lifetime of the shoe is proportional to the thickness of the sole (assuming nothing else breaks!!). Use $LT \\propto L$.\n",
