    "# 20. Seeing the Nano World â€“ Quick Introduction into Imaging Techniques in Nanotechnology\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the structure and function of materials at the **nanoscale** requires powerful imaging techniques that go far beyond conventional light microscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- SEM uses a **focused beam of electrons** to scan the surface of a sample.\n",
    "- Electrons interact with the atoms on the surface, generating signals:\n",
    "  - **Secondary electrons** â†’ show surface texture\n",
    "  - **Backscattered electrons** â†’ show contrast due to atomic number\n",
    "- Resolution: Down to **nanometre** scale\n",
    "\n",
    "> âœ… SEM is excellent for viewing **surface structures** of nanomaterials in 3D-like detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- TEM sends **electrons through** an ultra-thin sample.\n",
    "- Image is formed based on how electrons are **transmitted** or scattered.\n",
    "- Very high resolution â€” can see individual **atoms** in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> âœ… TEM is ideal for studying **internal structures** at the atomic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.3 Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.3.1 Principle:\n",
    "- A sharp **metal tip** is brought close to a conducting surface.\n",
    "- A **voltage** is applied between tip and sample.\n",
    "- **Quantum tunneling** of electrons occurs:\n",
    "  - When the tip is near the surface, electrons can \"tunnel\" through the vacuum gap.\n",
    "  - **Tunneling current** increases as tip gets closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.3.2 Imaging:\n",
    "- If current is kept constant, the tip **moves up and down** to maintain it.\n",
    "- This motion is used to **map the surface** with atomic resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ’¡ STM was the first technique to directly **image individual atoms** on surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.4 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.4.1 How it works:\n",
    "- A **cantilever with a sharp tip** is brought near the sample surface.\n",
    "- **Forces** between the tip and surface (van der Waals, electrostatic, etc.) cause the cantilever to deflect.\n",
    "- A **laser beam** tracks the deflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.4.2 Hookeâ€™s Law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = kx$$\n",
    "- **F**: Force\n",
    "- **k**: Spring constant of cantilever\n",
    "- **x**: Deflection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20.4.3 Advantages:\n",
    "- Works on **non-conductive materials**\n",
    "- Can image **soft biological samples** (e.g. DNA, proteins)\n",
    "- Can image in aqueous environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.5 Fluorescence Microscopy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used to image **specific molecules** in biological samples.\n",
    "- Sample is treated with **fluorescent dyes** or tagged proteins.\n",
    "- When excited by light of one wavelength, fluorophores **emit light** at another wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "> âœ… Useful for **live-cell imaging**, tracking molecules, and bio-labeling.\n",
