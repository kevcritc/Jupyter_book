    "# 10. Introduction to Carbon Nanomaterials\n",
    "Nanomaterials are materials that have structural features at the nanometer scale, typically below 100 nm. Carbon nanomaterials exhibit unique mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them essential in modern technology.\n",
    "## 10.1 Buckminsterfullerene (C60) — The First Molecular Solid of Carbon\n",
    "### 10.1.1 Discovery\n",
    "In 1985 scientists studying carbon vapour produced by laser ablation of graphite observed an unusually stable cluster containing 60 carbon atoms.  \n",
    "The structure was proposed to be a hollow cage molecule and later confirmed experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecule was named **Buckminsterfullerene** after architect Buckminster Fuller because its geometry matches a geodesic dome.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bucky ball structure](images/buckyball.jpeg)\n",
    "Fig 10.1 Buckminsterfullerene structure\n",
    "Common names:\n",
    "- C60\n",
    "- Buckminsterfullerene\n",
    "- Bucky Ball\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.2 Molecular Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "C60 is a closed spherical cage molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topology:\n",
    "- 60 carbon atoms (vertices)\n",
    "- 32 faces\n",
    "  - 12 pentagons\n",
    "  - 20 hexagons\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the same pattern as a football.\n",
    "Pentagons never touch each other.  \n",
    "Each pentagon is surrounded only by hexagons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **Isolated Pentagon Rule (IPR)** and is required for stability because adjacent pentagons would introduce too much strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.3 Bonding\n",
    "\n",
    "Each carbon atom is **sp² hybridised**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore each carbon forms:\n",
    "- 3 sigma (σ) bonds to neighbouring carbons\n",
    "- 1 remaining p orbital\n",
    "\n",
    "The p orbitals combine to form a delocalised π electron system extending over the entire sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "C60 is therefore:\n",
    "> a single giant conjugated molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two distinct bond types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bond | Location | Character |\n",
    "|------|--------|------|\n",
    "| 6–6 bond | between two hexagons | shorter (double-bond-like) |\n",
    "| 6–5 bond | pentagon–hexagon | longer (single-bond-like) |\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrons are delocalised but not uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.4 Why the Molecule is Curved\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphene is flat because hexagons tile a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pentagons introduce positive curvature.  \n",
    "Adding 12 pentagons forces the sheet to wrap into a sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "C60 can therefore be viewed as:\n",
    "> a wrapped graphene sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.5 Electronic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each carbon contributes one π electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "60 carbons → 60 π electrons\n",
    "\n",
    "These occupy molecular orbitals spread over the whole cage and produce:\n",
    "- HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital)\n",
    "- LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital)\n",
    "- an energy gap\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore C60 is **not a metal**.\n",

    "It behaves as a **molecular semiconductor**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.6 Solid C60 (Molecular Crystal)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the solid state the molecules do not form covalent bonds to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are held together by van der Waals forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces a **molecular crystal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "- soft solid\n",

    "### 10.1.7 Optical Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "C60 appears black.\n",
    "\n",
    "The delocalised π system produces many electronic transitions across the visible range, causing broad absorption of visible light.  \n",
    "Very little light is reflected, so the material looks black.\n",

    "## 10.2 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)\n",

    "- We can think of rolling up a sheet graphene, and the way it's rolled defines the properties of the CNT. In realisty this is not how CNTs are made - they are chemically synthesised and the starting material is not graphene!\n",
    "- Each carbon atom is **sp² hybridised**, forming **three strong sigma (σ) bonds** with neighbouring carbon atoms.\n",
    "- The remaining **unhybridised p orbital** forms a **delocalised π-bonding system**, extending above and below the tube surface — similar to that in benzene or graphite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.2.2 Chirality and Types\n",
    "The way the graphene is rolled is described by the **chiral vector** (**n, m**), which leads to different types of CNTs:\n",
    "- **Armchair (n = m):** Metallic\n",
    "- **Zigzag (m = 0 or n = 0):** Can be metallic or semiconducting\n",
