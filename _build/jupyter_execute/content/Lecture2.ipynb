    "If we take a piece of iron and split it, it's still iron - just a bit smaller.  Imagine if it was possible to keep splitting until it is not posible to split it anymore.  This is idea that the Greeks philosophers where thinking about.  Is it possible to split an infinte number of times or is there a limit (assuming tools is not the limitation).  We will come back to this idea in the next lecture.  For now, we know that atoms are the limit.\n",

    "### The Classical View of Atoms\n",
    "- **Nucleus**: Composed of **protons** (+ve charge) and **neutrons** (neutral).\n",
    "- Surrounded by **electrons** (-ve charge), creating a balance where the number of protons equals the number of electrons.\n",
    "- **Atomic number (Z)**: Number of protons.\n",
    "- **Atomic weight (A)**: Sum of protons and neutrons (**A = N + Z**).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mass & Scale\n",
    "- **Proton Mass**: ~1.673 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg (or 1 atomic mass unit, amu/u).\n",
    "- **Electron Mass**: ~9.110 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg (electrons are ~2000x lighter than protons).\n",
    "- **Nuclear Radius**: Typically **0.8-10 femtometers (fm)** (1 fm = **10<sup>-15</sup> meters**).\n",
    "- **Scale comparison**: A **1 cm** nucleus corresponds to a **1 km** atom in size.\n"

    "The mathematics of an electron orbiting a proton are indentical to a planet orbiting the Sun in our solar system.  This latter solution maths was famously developed Newton who is the father of Mechanics and therefore it is unsuprising that wehn it is applied to the Atom it becomes 'Quantum' Mechanics.  We will address Quantum mechanics in later lectures without worrying too much about the actual mathematics.  The importance of atoms to nanotechnology cannot be understated.\n",

    "### So How Small is \"Small\"?\n",
    "- The **nanometer scale** involves sizes of **1-100 nm** (1 nm = **10<sup>-9</sup> meters**).\n",
    "- **Atoms** range in size from approximately **0.1-0.4 nm**. A single device or machine that is just a few atoms thick would be around **1 nm** in size.\n",
    "- Understanding scale:\n",
    "  - **1 nm** is to **1 meter** as a **marble** is to the **Earth**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nanotechnology requires assembling **10s to 1000s of atoms** to create functional structures. This is why nanomachines are often at least **1 nm** thick.\n",
