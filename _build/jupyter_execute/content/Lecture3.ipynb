    "## 3.1 Why make things smaller?\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniaturisation — making devices and components smaller — offers a wide range of benefits across science, engineering, and everyday technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 Greater Efficiency and Speed\n",
    "Smaller components can operate faster, especially in electronics where reduced distances for signals mean quicker processing. This is key in modern microprocessors and communication devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2 Lower Power Consumption\n",
    "Miniaturised devices often use less energy, which extends battery life in portable electronics and reduces energy costs in larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 Portability and Convenience\n",
    "Smaller devices are easier to carry, install, and integrate — think of smartphones, wearables, or implantable medical sensors. They make technology more accessible and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.4  Cost Reduction (at scale)\n",
    "Once developed, miniaturised components can often be mass-produced more cheaply, especially using techniques like photolithography in chip manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.5 New Applications\n",
    "Miniaturisation opens the door to new fields like **nanomedicine**, **lab-on-a-chip** technologies, **MEMS** (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), and **wearable tech**, where larger versions simply wouldn’t work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.6 Improved Functionality\n",
    "Smaller doesn't mean simpler — miniaturisation allows more features to be packed into the same space, like multiple sensors or antennas inside a single chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A Key point. Miniaturisation has several key benefits. In otherwords there is motivation beyound doing things for the sake of it.  You should be able to recall a few of these points and application but you do not need to know specific values.  Have a go at thinking of your own examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.4.1 What are Scaling Laws?\n",
    "Scaling laws allow us to simplify complex systems by estimating how physical quantities change as the size of the system is scaled. We as, physicsists, always make the simplist possible model and then add complexity - not the other way around. Rather than worrying about multiple dimensions we will simplify objects as have a single characteristic size, L.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the box in Fig 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "$ V = wht $\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Where `w`, `h`, and `t` are the width, height and thickness of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Surface Area (S)**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ S=2(tw +th +wh)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- When all dimensions are equal (`w = h = t = L`), the characteristic length (`L`) can be used to see how the volume and surface area change as we shrink or enlarge the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "- $ V \\propto L^3 $\n",
    "- $ S \\propto L^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:  \n",
    "- The surface area to volume ratio $ \\frac{S}{V} $ is inversely proportional to the characteristic length: $ \\frac{S}{V} \\propto \\frac{1}{L} $\n",
    "While this seems trival, it is a **keypoint** as we shrink object the surface area becomes much large compared to the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.3 Examples:\n",
    "1. **Heat Loss**: Heat loss to the environment is proportional to surface area. As objects get larger, the relative heat loss decreases.\n",
    "2. **Catalytic Activity**: Activity scales with surface area, so reducing volume of the catalyst (while maintaining the total mass) increases catalytic efficiency per unit mass.  This is a key for saving energy in chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Mass**: $m \\propto L^3 $  \n",
    "  - The mass of bodies increase cubically with size (not suprising, but important for propagating the concept).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friction**: At the macro-scale, friction is **independent of the contact surface area**. However, at the nanoscale, friction and adhesion increase with contact area $ \\propto L^2 $.  Interestingly the understanding of friction at different scale is actually not fully understood.  What is the friction between to atoms? DOes it make sense to even call it friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wear and Lifetime (LT)**: Wear is related to device lifetime, as it scales with the thickness of the material. Thinner materials tend to have shorter lifetimes because erosion rates are linear. A pair of shoes with a thick sole last longer than a shoe with a thin sole.  In fact the lifetime of the shoe is proportional to the thickness of the sole (assuming nothing else breaks!!). Use $LT \\propto L$.\n",
