    "# 1. Introduction to the Nanotechnology\n",
    "\n",
    "From medical applications to quantum computing, the ability to control materials at the nanoscale is transforming how we design and build new technologies. Nanotechnology allows us to manipulate matter at the level of atoms and molecules — typically less than 100 nanometres — where materials often behave in fundamentally different ways. These changes are driving innovation across many sectors, including energy, electronics, healthcare, and materials science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we’ll explore some of the exciting applications of nanotechnology, while also grounding our understanding in the scientific principles that make these innovations possible. We'll begin with some foundational material — much of it extending ideas you're already familiar with from A-levels or GCSEs (or equivalent) — and build towards an appreciation of how nanoscale science underpins real-world technologies. \n",
