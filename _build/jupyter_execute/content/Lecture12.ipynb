    "### 2.1 Energy Bands in Solids\n",
    "In an atom, electrons occupy discrete energy levels. However, when a large number of atoms bond to form a solid, their outer electron energy levels merge into continuous bands:\n",
    "- **Valence Band (VB):** The highest energy band that is fully occupied at absolute zero.\n",
    "- **Conduction Band (CB):** The next available band where electrons can move freely.\n",
    "- **Band Gap (Eg):** The energy difference between the valence and conduction bands, given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_g = E_c - E_v$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $E_c$ is the conduction band minimum,\n",
    "- $E_v$ is the valence band maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Silicon and 3p Levels\n",
    "Silicon (Si) atoms have electron configurations ending in **3s² 3p²**. When many Si atoms bond to form a crystal lattice, their 3p orbitals interact, leading to the formation of **bonding and antibonding states**:\n",
    "- As the atomic spacing decreases, the interaction between Si atoms increases, and discrete energy levels broaden into bands.\n",
    "- Initially, when only a few atoms interact, molecular orbitals form from the individual 3p atomic orbitals.\n",
    "- As more atoms are added, these orbitals split into a nearly continuous density of states.\n",
    "- The **bonding states** form the valence band, while the **antibonding states** form the conduction band.\n",
    "- The energy separation between these bands is the **band gap**, approximately **1.1 eV** for silicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Influence of Atomic Spacing on Density of States\n",
    "- **Large Atomic Spacing:** The energy levels remain discrete with a small number of available states.\n",
    "- **Reducing Atomic Spacing:** Overlapping wavefunctions cause increased band formation and the density of states increases.\n",
    "- **Very Small Atomic Spacing:** Strong interactions cause broad bands with a nearly continuous range of energy levels.\n",
    "- **At the Equilibrium Lattice Constant:** The energy bands stabilize, defining the semiconductor properties such as band gap and effective mass of carriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification of Materials by Band Gap\n",
    "- **Conductors:** No band gap, as the conduction and valence bands overlap.\n",
    "- **Semiconductors:** Small band gap (~0.1-3 eV) allowing thermal excitation of electrons.\n",
    "- **Insulators:** Large band gap (>3 eV) preventing electron excitation at room temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Semiconductor Materials\n",
    "- **Intrinsic Semiconductors:** Pure materials like silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), where thermal excitation generates electron-hole pairs.\n",
    "- **Extrinsic Semiconductors:** Doped semiconductors with additional charge carriers.\n",
    "  - **n-type:** Introduces extra electrons using elements like phosphorus.\n",
    "  - **p-type:** Introduces holes using elements like boron.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Electrical Conductivity in Semiconductors\n",
    "At absolute zero, semiconductors behave as insulators. However, at higher temperatures:\n",
    "- Thermal energy, $E = \\frac{3}{2} kT$, excites a small number of electrons to the conduction band.\n",
    "- These electrons contribute to electrical conduction along with holes moving in the valence band.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Density of Free Carriers\n",
    "The intrinsic carrier concentration is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$n_i = \\sqrt{N_c N_v} e^{-E_g/2kT}$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $N_c$ and $N_v$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Applications of Semiconductors\n",
    "- **Transistors and Microelectronics:** Basis of modern computing.\n",
    "- **Solar Cells:** Convert sunlight into electricity.\n",
    "- **LEDs and Lasers:** Utilize semiconductor band structures for photon emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This section covered the fundamental principles of LSPR and semiconductors, including their physical origins, governing equations, and practical applications. Future topics will explore quantum confinement, band structure engineering, and advanced semiconductor devices.\n"
