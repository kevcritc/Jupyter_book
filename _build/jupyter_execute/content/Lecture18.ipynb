    "# ⚕️ Nanomedicine – Medical Nanoparticles (Part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 RECAP: Medical Nanoparticles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Types:\n",
    "1. **Lipid-based nanoparticles** (e.g., liposomes)\n",
    "2. **Polymer-based nanoparticles** and **polymer therapeutics**\n",
    "3. **Inorganic nanoparticles**, such as **metal-coated nanoshells**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧵 2. Polymeric Nanoparticles\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Polymers?\n",
    "- **Polymers** are long molecules made up of repeated units (monomers).\n",
    "- Can mimic natural biological macromolecules like **proteins**, **antibodies**, and **DNA**.\n",
    "- Can be engineered to **elicit specific biological responses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Polymeric Nanoparticles\n",
    "- **Biodegradable**: Break down naturally in the body.\n",
    "- **Stimuli-responsive**: Can release drugs in response to pH, temperature, etc.\n",
    "- **Targeted delivery**: Surface can be modified to attach to specific cells (e.g., cancer cells).\n",
    "- **Tunable properties**: Adjust molecular weight, hydrophobicity, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amphiphilic Polymers and Micelles\n",
    "- **Amphiphilic polymers** have both **hydrophilic** and **hydrophobic** segments.\n",
    "- In water, they **self-assemble** into **micelles**:\n",
    "  - Hydrophobic **core** (traps hydrophobic drugs)\n",
    "  - Hydrophilic **shell** (interacts with the surrounding fluid)\n",
    "- Used for **drug delivery** as **core-shell nanoparticles**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 These micelles are like soap bubbles carrying fat-soluble drugs in a water-based bloodstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymer Therapeutics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of loading drugs **inside** a nanoparticle, drugs are **chemically linked** (conjugated) to the polymer.\n",
    "- Improves properties like:\n",
    "  - **Serum half-life** (how long a drug stays in the bloodstream)\n",
    "  - **Solubility**\n",
    "  - **Targeting**\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- **PEGylated interferon** for **Hepatitis C**\n",
    "  - Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) attached to protein drug\n",
    "- **Glycopolymer-conjugated insulin**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ 3. Inorganic Nanoshells\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure:\n",
    "- **Core–shell structure**:\n",
    "  - **Core**: Silica or hydrogel (can hold drugs, proteins, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Shell**: Thin metal layer (commonly **gold**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Metal Coatings?\n",
    "- Metal shells can be functionalized easily (e.g., attach antibodies)\n",
    "- They interact with **electromagnetic radiation** in a special way:\n",
    "  - **Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delocalised electrons** in metal respond to light (oscillating electric field).\n",
    "- **Collective oscillation** of electrons → **surface plasmons**\n",
    "- When the frequency of incoming light matches the resonance frequency:\n",
    "  - Electrons absorb energy → excite → relax\n",
    "  - Energy released as **heat**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔥 This photothermal effect is harnessed to **destroy cells** like tumours.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Nanoshell-Assisted Photothermal Therapy (NAPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: **AuroShell®**\n",
    "- **Silicon core (120 nm)** + **Gold shell** + **Polymer coating**\n",
    "- Designed to absorb **Near Infrared (NIR)** light (deep tissue penetration)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Injected intravenously** into the bloodstream\n",
    "2. **Accumulates in tumours** due to **Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR)** effect\n",
    "3. Tumour illuminated with **NIR laser**\n",
    "4. **Nanoshells absorb NIR**, convert to **heat**\n",
    "5. Heat **kills tumour cells** and blood vessels — **minimal damage** to healthy tissue\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🩺 **Only clinically trialled NAPT agent** for solid tumours: prostate, head/neck, lung.\n",

    "## 🧠 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymer-based nanoparticles** offer flexibility, biodegradability, and tunability.\n",
    "- **Polymer therapeutics** improve drug behaviour through chemical conjugation.\n",
    "- **Inorganic nanoshells** enable **targeted heat-based cancer treatment** using plasmonic properties of metals.\n",
    "- **Photothermal therapy** is a promising non-invasive method in cancer nanomedicine.\n",
